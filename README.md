1) Paste the 'Gow Weather' folder to 'C:\Roof'.
	- Should look like this: 'C:\Roof\Gow Weather\%files%'

2) Right click "Weather.vbs" and hover over "Send to", click "Desktop (create shortcut)".
	- You now have a shortcut on your desktop that you can click on and it will run the weather program.


Thanks for using my fun side-project!
