<b>1) Paste the 'Gow Weather' folder to 'C:\Roof'.</b>

<i>Should look like this: 'C:\Roof\Gow Weather\%files%'</i>


<b>2) Right click "Weather.vbs" and hover over "Send to", click "Desktop (create shortcut)".</b>

<i>You now have a shortcut on your desktop that you can click on and it will run the weather program.</i>


Thanks for using my fun side-project!
